Databases!

What is a database?
    Collection of data
        Stored in Tables in Row/Column format
        We can apply individual rules to each column
        An instance in a row is called a record
        Tables have a plural name since they are meant to hold multiple things

What is the tool called that we use to manage and interact with our DB?
    RDBMS - Relational DataBase Management System
What is SQL?
    Structured Querying Language

IF we want to create a DB that will persist
    sqlite3 <db name>.db

To see all the tables in our db, we can run the ".tables" command

With SQL, we MUST end our lines with a ";"
    This is because SQL is going to take our multi-line commands and put it all on one line, so SQL needs to know when we're done

We can create SQL file for us to write SQL commands in. This makes editing commands much easier!

To run a .sql file in our sqlite terminal, we use the .read command
